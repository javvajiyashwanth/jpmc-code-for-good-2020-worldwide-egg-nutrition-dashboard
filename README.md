# Sight & Life Foundation
Sight and Life Foundation is a humanitarian nutrition think tank working to innovate in nutrition towards eradicating all forms of malnutrition. This project was developed by Team-3 for CodeForGood-2020 and is focused on creating a web-based platform for visualizing the supply and demand of eggs in a particular country.
